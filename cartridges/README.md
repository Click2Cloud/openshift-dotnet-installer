Contains all the Windows Cartridges

The pssproj files in this solution can be opened in Visual Studio using the [PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio extension](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c9eb3ba8-0c59-4944-9a62-6eee37294597).

All the pssproj projects have been modified (manually) to include custom msbuild targets that publish the cartridges in the [project root]\output directory.
